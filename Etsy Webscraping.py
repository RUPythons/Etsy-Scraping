#Running all this code can take a few minutes so in order to save time you may want to put hashtags next to the print statements and loops, especially after you
#run it once.  Also please note, every time you run the image download loop it will save all those images (1752).  And again you have to download and install
#BeautifulSoup in order for everything to work
